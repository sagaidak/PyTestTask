It also creates an encrypted version of that key using private key.

If they do, LAMP knows that the client is honest about the key being given to him(and he has not randomly generated it)\r\nLAMP then checks s3 to make sure that the file with that key exists, if it does,then delete the row which was added in 2.\r\nAfter asking around, I was told that it is not possible for s3 itself to verify that a file is a 'valid' file of a certain type(I want to enforce only images ) So I decided to use aws lambda to verify it(if its a 'wrong' file, just delete it) . Just after the file is uploaded to s3, lambda can be fired.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is possible that BEFORE lambda finishes checking the file,step 7 above gets executed.
